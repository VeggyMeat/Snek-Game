- Make Snake head more general, so that it doesnt have to be player, so enemies can be SNEKS


- Make a pickup controller, that can be inherited from, to add pickup-able items off of the ground


- Make an xp system for the snake rather than just the bodies


- Remove XP system from bodies


- Make a scene that will be triggered on level up, allowing the player to pick an item / body to add / upgrade




- Remove Snake / Body class ( DONE )

Move Snake / Body features into the controller


 ---- Movement rework: ----  ( DONE )
Each body part has a mass
some body parts give extra speed

 -- EASY -- 
scale the velocity of the head of the snake inversely proportional to the total mass of snek

 -- HARD --
make it physically realistic, head applies a force instead of speed. Then the chain tension force acts both ways on each section.

Would have to go back through every body in the chain and keep resolving until gaps are small OR just accept that there will be gaps.

IDEA: go through each segment and compare ALL previous segments to next one and equalise.

(maybe not as hard)


- Learn how to do collisions, so that projectiles can actually deal damage to things ( DONE )


- Start thinking about enemies ( DONE )
